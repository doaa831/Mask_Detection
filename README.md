# Mask_Detection
The Face Mask Detection System relies on the concepts of Computer vision and Deep learning
using OpenCV and Tensorflow / Keras in order to detect face masks in still images
as well as in real-time video streams.

This dataset consists of 3835 images that fall into two categories:

    with_mask: 1916 images
    without_mask: 1919 images

The photos used were actual photos of faces wearing masks. Pictures were collected from the following sources:

    Bing Search API [(See Python script)](https://github.com/chandrikadeb7/Face-Mask-Detection/blob/master/search.py)
    Kaggle datasets
    RMFD dataset[(See here)](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset)
